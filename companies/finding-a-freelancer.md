# Finding a freelancer

## What kind of freelancers can I find on Uplink?

* Everything IT: Developers, DevOps, QA, PM, Scrum etc.
* Located in Germany
* German- or English-speaking
* No agencies, but single freelancers or small teams

## How can I post a job?

* Form on our website
* Email: hello@uplink.tech
* Call us: ...
* Minimum rate: 80â‚¬

## What happens after my job is posted?

* Candidates apply
* We vet them \(no coding test\)
* We introduce them to you
* etc.

## How are candidates introduced to me?

* Via our client backend
* You only have 48 hours to respond \(why?\)

## Why do I only have a limited time to respond to a freelancer introduction?

Before we introduce a freelancer to you, we talk to them in detail about the project, the required skills. and the conditions \(onsite/remote, fulltime/parttime etc.\). The freelancer also tells us, from when on and for how long she will be available.

For that reason, the introduction normally expires after 48 hours \(unless a different period has been agreed upon\).

It can always happen that you need more time, in which case we ask you to let us know via the "I need more time" button that is visible above the freelancer profile. Please don't let the introduction expire, since the freelancer is waiting for feedback from you!
