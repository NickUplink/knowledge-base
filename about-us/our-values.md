# Our values

Uplink was founded with the goal of offering freelancers a simple, fair and transparent alternative to classic IT recruiters. Therefore, we decided to do some things very differently from how they do them:

* **We are as open and transparent as possible.** This means we pass on all information that we have about a client or project to you, as early as possible. If we see any problems, we warn the freelancers \(or don't take on the client in the first place\). If we know any other freelancers who work or worked for the client, we try to connect them to new candidates early on.
* **We charge the freelancers instead of the clients.** As the old saying goes "If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold." Every recruiter who only charges the company \(either one-time or regularly on top of your rate\) is incentivized to see them as the paying client and you as the product \(or 'resource'\) being sold, and act accordingly. We try to reverse these incentives by making you, the freelancers, our paying clients.
* **We don't squeeze in between you and the client.** You make a contract \(or handshake agreement, if you prefer\) and issue your invoices directly to the client.
