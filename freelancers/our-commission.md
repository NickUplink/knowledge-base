# Our commission

For [direct jobs](https://kb.uplink.tech/freelancers/job-arrangements#direct), meaning that you work directly for the client who posted the job with us, we charge you a commission of 10% of what you invoice the client, for the first 6 months of your collaboration.

To that end, we ask you to send us the invoices you issue to the client, either via Slack in the channel that was created for your application \(our preferred way\) or via email to [invoices@uplink.tech](mailto:invoices@uplink.tech). We will then send you our invoice for the commission 

## Why not just charge the company instead of the freelancer?

This is the question we hear most often - why don't we invoice the company for our services, like most \(all?\) other providers do?

We argue that this would not in your best interest as a freelancer.

The advantage for the client is that they don't have to sign a contract with us and will never get a separate invoice from us, which makes it very attractive for them to post their jobs through Uplink.

In the end, it mostly doesn't matter who pays the fees though, since the companies know we charge the freelancers a commission and most freelancers add it on top of their rate.

### What happens after those 6 months?

If you work for the client for longer than 6 months, or the client returns after a year to work with you again, we don't charge you a commission anymore and you keep 100% of what you earn.

### What happens if the client doesn't pay me?

### What happens if the project is cut short?
