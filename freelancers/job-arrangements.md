# Job arrangements

## Direct

Most of the jobs we post are from clients who want to work directly with freelancers - no recruiters, agencies, or other middlemen involved.

Those clients are happy to sign a contract directly with the freelancer and the freelancers also write their invoices directly to the client.

For direct jobs, we charge the freelancer a [commission of 10% for the first six month of working with the client.](https://kb.uplink.tech/freelancers/our-commission)

## Middleman

In January 2020, we started a cooperation with Modis, an IT recruiting agency. Initially, it will be a 6-month trial, during which we will post selected freelancer jobs from Modis in our community and our freelancers can apply to them. [You can read more about the cooperation here.](https://uplink.tech/blog/announcing-our-cooperation-with-modis/)

We will introduce matching candidates to Modis, and Modis will introduce them to the end customer. From then on, the relationship is between the freelancer and Modis \(and the end customer of course\).

For these kind of jobs we do not charge [our commission](https://kb.uplink.tech/freelancers/our-commission). You will keep 100% of the rate that you negotiate with Modis, so there is no downside to applying to the job through us compared to going directly to Modis.
