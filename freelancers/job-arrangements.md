# Job arrangements

## Direct

Our main business is posting jobs from clients who want to work directly with freelancers - no recruiters, middlemen, agencies or however you might call them.

Those clients are happy to sign a contract directly with the freelancers themselves and they are also invoiced directly by the freelancers.

## Middleman

In January 2020, we started a cooperation with Modis, an IT recruiting agency. Initially, it will be a 6-month trial, during which we will post selected freelancer jobs from Modis in our community and our freelancers can apply to them. [You can read more about the cooperation here.](https://uplink.tech/blog/announcing-our-cooperation-with-modis/)

We will introduce matching candidates to Modis, and Modis will introduce them to the end customer. From then on, the relationship is between the freelancer and Modis \(and the end customer\).

For jobs from Modis \(and other potential middlemen in the future\) we do not charge [our commission](https://kb.uplink.tech/freelancers/our-commission). You will keep 100% of the rate that you negotiate with Modis, so there is no downside if you found the job through Uplink or directly from Modis.
