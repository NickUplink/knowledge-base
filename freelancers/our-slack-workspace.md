# Our Slack workspace

[Back in November 2017, we decided to create a Slack workspace for all our members](https://medium.com/uplink-it-freelancer-network/lets-move-to-slack-86558368e6d8) and use it as our primary communication channel for job offers, meetup invitations, public announcements, and everything else that we wanted to relay to our members. This has turned out to be a good decision, because the fantastic [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/) has allowed us to automate many things, including most of the job application process.

## Restrictions

Since we're on the free plan, we have a few restrictions:

### No email notifications after a period of inactivity

When a Slack user is not \(or only very little\) active in a Slack workspace for 14 days, the user will be marked as "inactive". If another 60 days go by without the user becoming "active" again, Slack stops sending him/her email notifications for this workspace.
