# Our Slack workspace

[Back in November 2017, we decided to create a Slack workspace for all our members](https://medium.com/uplink-it-freelancer-network/lets-move-to-slack-86558368e6d8) and use it as our primary communication channel for job postings, meetup invitations, public announcements, and everything else that we wanted to relay to our members. This has turned out to be a good decision, because the fantastic [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/) has allowed us to automate many things, including most of the job application process.

## Public channels

The following public channels are open for all members:

* **\#announcements** - Official announcements from the Uplink team. Only admins can post in this channel, but everyone can \(and is encouraged to\) comment in a thread on the announcements!
* **\#business** - Let’s talk about taxes, finances, insurance, freelancer registration and company incorporation! Feel free to ask for help if you’re new to the game!
* **\#events** - Are you planning to attend a meetup or conference soon? Let the other Uplink members know! Upcoming Uplink meetups and events will also be posted here.
* **\#ideas** - Do you have an idea for a new project/service/business? Share it here to get feedback!
* **\#investing** - Chat about where to be invest your hard-earned money, be it in stocks, bonds, ETF, crypto etc.
* **\#labs** - If you’re interested to hear what the Uplink team is working on and give feedback on ideas for new features, join this channel!
* **\#lounge** - Fun stuff, discussions about life and the universe, screenshots of the most absurd recruiter requests, and everything else non-business related.

## Job channels

Once a new job is published, it is posted to one or \(most of the time\) multiple job channels, where all members can apply for it. As a member, you can simply join the channels you are interested in \(e.g., if you'd only like to hear about jobs with React.js or Java, join **\#jobs-fe-react** and **\#jobs-be-java**\) and you will receive a mobile or desktop notification from Slack when a new job ist posted.

**\#jobs** is the main channel where all new jobs are posted to. If you really would like to be notified of every new job, no matter where the client is located or which skills are required, join this channel!

### Jobs by location

If you're only interested in jobs in Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt, or München, or full-remote jobs, join one of these channels:

* **\#jobs-berlin** - Jobs in Berlin
* **\#jobs-hamburg** - Jobs in Hamburg
* **\#jobs-frankfurt** - Jobs in Frankfurt
* **\#jobs-muenchen** - Jobs in München
* **\#jobs-remote** - Jobs that can be done completely remotely \(apart from possibly a kickoff meeting at the client's office\)

### Jobs by technologies/skills

If you're interested in jobs that have a requirement for a specific technology or skill, join one of these channels.

Note that the channels **\#jobs-be**, **\#jobs-fe**, and **\#jobs-mb** will receive all job postings from their sub-groups, i.e. every job posted to **\#jobs-be-ruby** will also be posted to **\#jobs-be**.

* **\#jobs-cms** - Jobs with a focus on CMS \(WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, TYPO3, etc.\)
* **\#jobs-devops** - Jobs with a focus on DevOps \(Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, etc.\)
* **\#jobs-ecommerce -** Jobs with a focus on e-commerce \(Magento, WooCommerce, Shopify, etc.\)
* **\#jobs-pm-agile** - Jobs for PMs, Scrum Masters, Agile Coaches etc.
* **\#jobs-ui-ux** - Jobs with a focus on UI/UX design
* **\#jobs-be** - Jobs with a focus on backend development
* **\#jobs-be-cpp**
* **\#jobs-be-dotnet**
* **\#jobs-be-go**
* **\#jobs-be-java**
* **\#jobs-be-node**
* **\#jobs-be-php**
* **\#jobs-be-python**
* **\#jobs-be-ruby**
* **\#jobs-fe**
* **\#jobs-fe-angular**
* **\#jobs-fe-react**
* **\#jobs-fe-vue**
* **\#jobs-mb**
* **\#jobs-mb-android**
* **\#jobs-mb-ios**
* **\#jobs-mb-hybrid**

### **Community jobs**

If you'd like to hear about jobs from other freelancers, join **\#jobs-community**!

Unlike the other job channels, **\#jobs-community** is open for everyone to post. If you have a personal project, but are missing the skills or time to work on it, or if you're working on a client project that you could need some help with, this is where you can find another freelancer from the community to work together with.

If you post in this channel, please keep a few things in mind:

* Be prepared to pay a market rate for the skills you're looking for. As a rule of thumb, it shouldn't be much less than what you would accept yourself if you were offered the job.
* Describe the tasks as detailed as possible to make the job appealing.
* Mention whether you'd like to meet the other freelancer or whether they can work completely remotely. Of course, jobs that can be done 100% remotely are much more attractive.
* Mention how interested freelancer should contact you. The easiest is "PM me for details" of course.

## Restrictions

Since we're on the free plan, we have a few restrictions:

### 10k messages limit

### No email notifications after a period of inactivity

When a Slack user is not \(or only very little\) active in a Slack workspace for 14 days, the user will be marked as "inactive". If another 60 days go by without the user becoming "active" again, Slack stops sending him/her email notifications for this workspace.
