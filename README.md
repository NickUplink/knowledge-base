# Welcome!

The goal of this Knowledge Base is to answer any question you might have about Uplink!

## What is Uplink?

Uplink is a network for IT freelancers in Germany. It was founded in 2016 and is headquartered in Berlin.

Our main goal is to offer fair, simple and transparent job placements as an alternative to classic IT recruiters.

In addition, we have a very active online and offline community. Online, our Slack workspace is our "club house" where all threads come together - job postings, discussions, announcements etc. Offline, many members of our community come to our monthly meetups in Berlin, Hamburg and MÃ¼nchen. We also organize Mastermind groups, Expert Sessions and other events.

## Language

To make all content accessible even to non-German speakers, we chose to write it in English.
